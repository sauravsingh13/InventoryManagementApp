| Assignment Detail |
---------------------
Create a login screen with username and password as 2 fields. Once user logins successfully, he should be navigated to products page. (via /products angular routing)

Products page should contain 3 components .

1. Product List Component
        - Shows list of products with fields as id and name.

2. Product Detail Component
        - Shows an angular form for reading, creating, updating and removing product. [Fields : name , price , rating (Use below Rating Component against rating label)]
        - Upon clicking on product name of Product List component, it should auto populate product info in Product Detail Component.

3. Rating Component
    - It simply shows a dropdown/select HTML element with 5 values ranging from 1 to 5.
   - This component should be a field inside product detail component (against the Rating field label of the Product Detail Component).

4. Stock Component
	- This component will show 2 values - Products Count and Products Price Total.
	- When the user performs any CRUD operations in the Products Detail component, then the Stock Component data should get updated in realtime. For example, if there are 5 products of $100 each in the database, then if you delete one product, then the count should show as 4 and the total price should show as $400.

There should be logout button on top navbar of products page.

NOTE: Feel free to use any third party CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Angular Material, etc.
